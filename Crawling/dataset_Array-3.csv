"Consider the leftmost and righmost appearances of some value in an array. We'll say that the ""span"" is the number of elements between the two inclusive. A single value has a span of 1. Returns the largest span found in the given array. (Efficiency is not a priority.)",2
"Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that every 3 is immediately followed by a 4. Do not move the 3's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 3's and 4's, every 3 has a number after it that is not a 3, and a 3 appears in the array before any 4.",2
"(This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.) Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4. In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array.",2
"Given a non-empty array, return true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side.",2
"Given two arrays of ints sorted in increasing order, outer and inner, return true if all of the numbers in inner appear in outer. The best solution makes only a single ""linear"" pass of both arrays, taking advantage of the fact that both arrays are already in sorted order.",2
"Given n>=0, create an array length n*n with the following pattern, shown here for n=3 : {0, 0, 1,    0, 2, 1,    3, 2, 1} (spaces added to show the 3 groups).",2
"Given n>=0, create an array with the pattern {1,    1, 2,    1, 2, 3,   ... 1, 2, 3 .. n} (spaces added to show the grouping). Note that the length of the array will be 1 + 2 + 3 ... + n, which is known to sum to exactly n*(n + 1)/2.",2
"We'll say that a ""mirror"" section in an array is a group of contiguous elements such that somewhere in the array, the same group appears in reverse order. For example, the largest mirror section in {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1} is length 3 (the {1, 2, 3} part). Return the size of the largest mirror section found in the given array.",2
"Say that a ""clump"" in an array is a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value. Return the number of clumps in the given array.",2
